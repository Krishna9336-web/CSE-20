    <h2>Illegal animal hunting, or poaching, is a critical issue because it threatens wildlife populations, disrupts ecosystems, and can lead to species extinction. Unlike historical hunting for survival, modern poaching is often for sport or to obtain animal parts for trade, making it an unsustainable and harmful practice. The illegal act of hunting can lead to severe environmental and social consequences, which has prompted governments and conservation groups to enforce stricter laws, increase penalties, and promote public awareness to combat this growing problem. 
Ecological impact
Disrupts ecosystems: Hunting disrupts the natural balance of an ecosystem and the food chain.
Threatens species: The decline of animal populations due to hunting has driven many species toward extinction.
Extinction: Some animal populations have been reduced to only a few hundred individuals because of hunting.
